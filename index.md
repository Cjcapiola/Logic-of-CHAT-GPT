# Logic Analysis of Various CHAT GPT Scripts
## Analysis of Causal Question: Discount Effect
The student uploaded a dataset relevant to a commercial chain that encodes:
- InvoiceNo: Invoice number (likely a unique identifier for each transaction)
- StockCode: Product/item code
- Description: Description of the product
- Quantity: The number of items purchased in the transaction
- InvoiceDate: Date and time of the invoice
- UnitPrice: Price per unit of the product
- CustomerID: Customer identifier
- Country: Country where the customer resides
This dataset has lots of different values which are predominately sorted by specific transactions and product numbers. The student then enlists the use of the LLM to derive causal questions that can be evaluated based on this dataset. The LLM posits the following question:

**"Does offering a discount (i.e., reducing the UnitPrice) lead to an increase in the Quantity of products sold for a particular product category?"**

The LLM correctly generated a causal question as it seeks to determine if A creates some change in B such that:
- A: The presence of a known discount (generated by decreasing the unit price of the items.
- B: The quantity of products sold.

The LLM suggested that this question should be analyzed in three parts such that:
- Product Category Identification: Since the dataset provides individual product descriptions but not broad categories, we might consider grouping similar products into makeshift categories based on their descriptions. Alternatively, we could choose a specific popular product as a proxy for its category.
- Discount Identification: We need to identify periods when discounts were offered. This could be done by looking at variations in the UnitPrice for the same product or category over time.
- Effect on Quantity: Once we've identified discount periods, we can compare the Quantity sold during discount periods with that of non-discount periods.

In an effort to streamline the process, the LLM suggested that they generate the analysis based on a specific popular product. While this would enable the analysis to provide a very specific and detailed description it inherently changes the nature of the question. With this method the question would instead be describing if a discount for a specific product then increases sales for the specific product. The student correctly identified that this would be changing the very nature of the question and suggested to the LLM that they instead do an analysis of each of the products.

The LLM accepted this statement, and started the analysis for the top ten products in the list. However, this generates the same issue as discussed previously. The causal question should now be restated:

**"Does offering a discount of the top ten most popular products lead to an increase in the Quantity of these products sold?"**

This question is different from what the student is actually asking, and therefore the resulting analysis will not be complete for any given product, only the top ten products.

The LLM used price fluctuations in each of the products to determine the nature of a "discount". This is a fair assessment if we assume that the price fluctuations are only dependent on the presence of any discount parameter. It does not take into account that the price fluctuations could be based on other confounding variables such as supply chain issues or inflation. It also makes the assumption that the quantity sold is only dependent on price which is not neccessarily the case. Demand is not inherently connected to price and could itself be impacted by confounding variables such as the time of year (Halloween decorations will be bought in massivley different quantities in October than in any other month) or popular trends that influence the psychological perception of demand. The student neglected to consider these possibilites and control for confounders and instead rushed the analysis through a simple model that likely does not very accurately measures the real world. 

The student then asked the LLM to determine how much more product will be sold for a 10% discount. The LLM created a very simple model that determines how much the quantity sold changes based on the percent discount. Again, the problem plaguing this entire analysis is derived from the fact that the model is not acknowledging the price and quantity changes based on the entire data set, but rather only the most popular ten products. The LLM identified that some of the popular products will actually see a price decrease given the discount. This makes sense as it failed to acknowledge the confounders stated above. However, the LLM does posit the following reasons for this interesting and likely inaccurate analysis:

- Price Elasticity: Not all products respond positively to discounts. Some products might have inelastic demand, meaning the quantity sold doesn't increase significantly with a price decrease.
- Perceived Value: Sometimes, lowering the price can affect the perceived value of a product. Customers might associate a higher price with better quality.
- Data Limitations: Our analysis is based on the assumption that changes in price are the only factor affecting the quantity sold. In reality, other factors like promotions, stock availability, seasonality, or external events could impact sales.
- Model Limitations: A linear regression might oversimplify the relationship between price and quantity. More complex models or techniques might provide different insights.

The LLM correctly describes some of the possible reasons for why the model may be inaccurate. It fails to recognize that the question asked by the student is relevant to any given product in the set not just the top ten most popular. The student then takes the answer and ends the analysis without any further inspection of the confounding variables leading to a highly simplifed and likely inaccurate model that answers a different causal question than what is asked.

## Analysis of Data in Order to Create a Funding Pitch
It appears that the student wished to use a LLM to interpert a data set with a number of key parameters on VC health. The dataset in question revolved around venture capital investments, aiming to offer insights into funding patterns, company profiles, and financial trajectories.

### Loading in The Supplied Data Set
As a part of the data interpretation process, the LLM attempted to load in the supplied CSV file. It threw an error in which it was unable to read the supplied data due to an encoding error. As an attempt to correct the issue, the LLM switched encoding languages and was able to properly load in the data. While this did not create any further challenges in this specific analysis, one could see how had the LLM not known that the encoding format was different it could potentially misinterpret the results failing the analysis from the very beginning.

The LLM then positied various approaches to analyse the dataset:
- Funding by Market: Which markets (industries) receive the most funding?
- Funding Rounds: What are the common funding rounds, and how much funding is typically raised in each round?
- Status of Companies: What is the distribution of company statuses (e.g., operating, acquired) and how does it relate to funding?
- Geographical Analysis: Are there particular regions or countries that attract more venture capital?
- Investment Types: Which types of investment (e.g., seed, venture, equity crowdfunding) are most common?

The student then proceed to prompt the LLM to analyse all of these factors to "get the company funded". While this data can be used to inform a pitch, the operational definition for "get the company funded" needed to be specific based on what possible investors might be looking for in a new company. Without, these defnitions, the LLM will attempt to process the data in a way that is relevant but likely not specific or helpful for an actual pitch.

### Data Cleaning
In an attempt to speed computation, the LLM used a simplified approach to cleaning the data set.  The system replaced any '-' in the 'funding_total_usd' column with '0', a decision that might oversimplify or misrepresent the data. The LLM assumes that '-' signifes zero. But in reality, having missing or unobtainable data is very different from having a value of 0. If the data was infact missing, then the entire relevant row should have been scrubbed. From this mistake in cleaning, the LLM introduced error and artifically changed the nautre of the dataset.

### Analysis
The LLM leveraged the use of visual graphic depictions to highlight trends that might be relevant for a VC pitch. While graphics are useful as a part of the presentaion, they can misrpresent the data to a vast degree depending on how the figure is displayed. For instance if the company had a growth of 10 dollars throughout the last fiscal year, any human would understand that 10 dollars is not that much and does not represent any real growth. However, if one generated a figure in which the y axis was 0.001 dollars, then the growth would appear astronomical and be highly misleading. Given the student did not describe any parameters relevant to how the figures should be displayed or captioned, the pure use of these visuals is not informative. 

The descriptive analyssis approach to creating a pitch is not very complex and does not take into account many of the intracacies of a company that are important to understand when seeking investment. There should be more weight given to inferential statistics, which would attempt to predict where the company is going. As a VC, my pitch would displayed in a way such that I can show how the investors current captial investment will grow over time. Providing data on how the company has grown in the past is innherently inaccurate and unhelpful given that the past did not have the addition of the captial investment inherently changing the parameters of the analysis. Providing a probabilitic model of the future with the proposed investment would be a much more convincing strategy.

Another limitation to this analysis was the fact that the LLM and the student failed to determine if the data uploaded was sufficent enough to even run statistical tests. Ensuring data quality is paramount. It involves verifying that the data is accurate, complete, reliable, relevant, and timely. Without this assessment, any insights derived run the risk of being skewed or misleading. There should have been commentary included on how the data might be limited. If this assumption was made then a pitch could be succesfful but the fact that it was not acknowledged is very misleading and is bad business practice. There was also a lack of identification of any colliders as it can be assumed that any metric of company health will be interconnected. This again results in even a larger skew of the data analysis resulting in a pitch that is not at all relevant to the actual company performance or the risk assessment of the possible investors

## Using LLM's To Create The Ultimate Fantasy Football Team
In this post, the student attempted to use an LLM to analyze a data set and create a team based on the comments from an open forum on which players might be the best. 

## LLM Analysis of The Supplied Data
The LLM correctly identified the data set as containing posts from a reddit thread formatted such that the columns read:
- Title: Title of the Reddit post.
- Score: Score (upvotes - downvotes) of the post.
- Id: Unique identifier for the post.
- Url: URL of the post or linked content.
- Comms_num: Number of comments on the post.
- Created: Timestamp of when the post was created (in epoch time).
- Body: Body text of the post (if any).
- Timestamp: Human-readable timestamp of when the post was created.

It is here that the major failure of this type of analysis is revealed. The LLM correctly commented that the most optimal way to create the best fantasy football team would be via an indepth analysis of player statistics, match outcomes, and other data that is relevant to the performance of each player over the course of a real season. Given the data set only provides input from a community, the analysis inherently introduces error as the outcomes are based on personal oppinion. It is true that some members of the reddit community may have done research of their own, but this cannot be confirmed as true or accurate even in cases where statistics are cited. 

The student prompted the LLM to create the fantasy football team based on the public sentiment of the reddit thread. This changes the very nature of the question asked. Instead of determining an optimal fantasy football team, the student is indireclty asking for the LLM to create the most "popular" fantasy football team which may or may not be representative of actual performances in the 2023 season. The LLM gave a few examples of how this analysis could be carried out including:

- Mention Frequency: Identify players who are mentioned most frequently in the titles and body of the posts. This can give us an idea of which players are being discussed the most, although it doesn't necessarily equate to them being the "best."
- Sentiment Analysis: Analyze the sentiment of posts that mention specific players. Positive sentiment could indicate that the player is well-regarded, while negative sentiment could suggest the opposite.
- Score & Comments: Consider the Reddit score (upvotes minus downvotes) and the number of comments on posts that mention players. A high score and many comments could indicate that the community agrees with the sentiment expressed in the post.

The student elects to go through the sentiment analysis process. All of the options produced by the LLM do not have any direct groundings in performance. The mention frequency analysis would result in "bad" players, who may be mentioned many times because of how poor their performance is, as options for the ultimate team. This route is clearly not applicable to the analysis. The sentiment analysis option provides a more nuanced approach as it attempts to see how "postively" certain players are talked about. This method is not adqeuate either as a popular or more well known player with a large cult following may have a positve sentiment that does not correlate with actual performance. The score and comments approach again introduces the issue of bias as the scoring system provides reasoning for whether or not that post is agreed upon by the community, not if that post has any relation to player performance. For instance a post that highlights accuratly how bad a player is will get many upvotes, and the analysis would choose to use that player. Howeveer, the actual nature of the post is directly contradictory to the goal of the analysis.

### Data Set Analysis
The student prompted the LLM to extract player names from the post via a simple analysis that extracted capitalized words or sequences of capitalized words to identify potential player names. This method is based on the assumption that player names will always be capitalized, which might not be the case in casual discussions. This method can generate many false positives, such as team names, days of the week, or any other capitalized terms. Without a definitive list of player names, this approach might miss many relevant names or include irrelevant ones. The LLM correctly cited this as being a potential problem with this method of analysis stating that it encoded many false postives such as "Comment," "He," "If," "The," "It," "You," "This," "What," and "Chelsea." The LLM correctly eliminated these terms from the data set, highlighting the lack of rigour in this method of analysis.

The LLM then attempted to do a sentiment analysis using a pre-defined function "TextBlob". TextBlob is a lexicon-based sentiment analysis tool. While it's useful for general sentiment analysis, it might not be adept at capturing the nuances of sports discussions. Additonally, sentiment doesn't necessarily correlate with a player's performance in fantasy football. A player could be popular and liked (positive sentiment) but may not be a good choice for a fantasy team due to form, injuries, or other factors. Since this analysis lacks context, a high sentiment score doesn't indicate why the sentiment is positive which introduces error and largely invalidates the very grounds for this analysis. 

This ranking method assumes that sentiment directly correlates with fantasy football performance, which is a flawed assumption. For instance, a player might be discussed positively due to off-field activities or personal achievements but may not be in good form on the field. The differences in sentiment scores among the top players were minor, making it challenging to differentiate between them based solely on sentiment. The LLM identified this as being a possible issue. The student indicated that they wished to start Son,  Raphinha,  Antonio and Shaw. However, a fantasy team requires a number of players put into a variety of balanced positions. This analysis doesnt account for this and would suggest to only include offensive players into the lineup because their performance is likely flashy and highly commented on. This does not produce a balanced team.

### Student Conclusions
The student asked the LLM to decide if this approach would be valid and the LLM responded with suggestions for other factors to include before starting the players. It determined that the analysis should take into account:

- Position & Role: Ensure you have a balanced team in terms of positions. For instance, having all attacking players without considering defense or midfield can be problematic.
- Fixtures: Upcoming fixtures play a vital role in fantasy football. A player might be in form, but if they have tough fixtures ahead, their points potential could be limited.
- Form: Recent performance is crucial. Players in good form are more likely to score points.
- Injury & Availability: Ensure none of these players are injured or suspended. Also, consider international duties or other reasons they might not play.
- Team Performance: Individual players' performances can be influenced by their team's overall performance.
- Price: In fantasy football, you have a budget. Ensure you can afford these players and still have a balanced team.

These recommendations are generic and not tailored to the specific players in question (Son, Raphinha, Antonio, Shaw). Without specific data on player form, upcoming fixtures, and other vital factors, the recommendations lacked depth and actionable insights. It appears as if the LLM answered the students question independently without any prior refereence to the data analysis completed earlier. 

Overall this analysis lacked a comprehensive data set that would be required to actually answer the question posed by the student. The entire analysis was based solely on Reddit discussions without incorporating actual player statistics, recent performances, injury status, or upcoming fixtures. Relying solely on sentiment from a subreddit can be misleading. This resulted in the LLM doing an analysis of sentiment rather than creating a football team. The LLM did not answer the students question and has no practical value for the student. Inherent to the scoring system used to gauge sentiment, the scores were treated as absolute without any investigation into the statisticsitcal signficance of each value. A slight difference in sentiment scores between two players doesn't necessarily mean one is a better choice for a fantasy team than the other and this was not addressed.

In this post specifically, it appears that the inability of the LLM to provide useful input into the creation of a fantasy football team was not neccessarily the fault of the LLM but the prompts given to it by the student. The student doomed the analysis from the very beginning by choosing a data set that provide no real value to the question. The student also proceeded to continue with an analysis that directly changed the nature of the question and did not account for what kind of result public sentiment is actually expressing. The LLM also incorporated some of its own errors by using improper methodologies for extracting relevant players and their statistics from the poor data set. While sentiment analysis can provide insights into public opinion it should not be used soley as a metric for determing a players current of future performance. The approach used in the analysis had several weaknesses and lacked the depth and specificity required to give a comprehensive answer to the student's query.
