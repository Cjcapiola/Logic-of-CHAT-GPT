## Analysis of Causal Question: Discount Effect
The student uploaded a dataset relevant to a commercial chain that encodes:
- InvoiceNo: Invoice number (likely a unique identifier for each transaction)
- StockCode: Product/item code
- Description: Description of the product
- Quantity: The number of items purchased in the transaction
- InvoiceDate: Date and time of the invoice
- UnitPrice: Price per unit of the product
- CustomerID: Customer identifier
- Country: Country where the customer resides
This dataset has lots of different values which are predominately sorted by specific transactions and product numbers. The student then enlists the use of the LLM to dervie causal questions that can be evaluated based on this dataset. The LLM posits the following question:

**"Does offering a discount (i.e., reducing the UnitPrice) lead to an increase in the Quantity of products sold for a particular product category?"**

The LLM correctly generated a causal question as it seeks to determine if A creates some change in B such that:
- A: The presence of a known discount (genereated by decreasing the unit price of the items.
- B: The quantitiy of products sold.

The LLM suggested that this question should be analyzed in three parts such that:
- Product Category Identification: Since the dataset provides individual product descriptions but not broad categories, we might consider grouping similar products into makeshift categories based on their descriptions. Alternatively, we could choose a specific popular product as a proxy for its category.
- Discount Identification: We need to identify periods when discounts were offered. This could be done by looking at variations in the UnitPrice for the same product or category over time.
- Effect on Quantity: Once we've identified discount periods, we can compare the Quantity sold during discount periods with that of non-discount periods.

In an effort to streamline the process, the LLM suggested that they generate the analysis based on a specific popular product. While this would enable the analysis to provide a very specific and detailed description it inherently changes the nature of the question. With this method the question would instead be describing if a discount for a specific product then increases sales for the specific product. The student correctly identified that this would be changing the very nature of the question and suggested to the LLM that they instead do an analysis of each of the products.

The LLM accepted this statement, and started the analysis for the top ten products in the list. However, this generates the same issue as disscused previously. The causal question should now be restated:

**"Does offering a discount of the top ten most popular products lead to an increase in the Quantity of these products sold?"**

This question is different from what the student is actually asking, and therefore the resulting analysis will not be complete for any given product, only the top ten products.

The LLM used price fluctuations in each of the products to determine the nature of a "discount". This is a fair assesment if we assume that the price fluctuations are only dependent on the presence of any discount parameter. It does not take into account that the price fluctuations could be based on other confounding variables such as supply chain issues or inflation. It also makes the assumption that the quantity sold is only dependent on price which is not neccessarily the case. Demand is not inherently connected to price and could itself be impacted by confounding variables such as the time of year (Halloween decorations will be bought in massivley different quantities in October than in any other month) or popular trends that influence the psychological perception of demand. The student neglected to consider these possibilites and control for confounders and instead rushed the analysis through a simple model that likely does not very accurretly measures the real world. 

The student then asked the LLM to determine how much more product will be sold for a 10% discount. The LLM created a very simple model that determines how much the quantity sold changes based on the percent discount. Again, the problem plauging this entire analysis is dervied from the fact that the model is not acknolwedging the price and quantity changes based on the entire data set, but rather only the most popular ten products. The LLM identified that some of the popular products will actually see a price decrease given the discount. This makes sense as it failed to acknoledge the counfounders stated above. However, the LLM does posit the following reasons for this interesting and likely inaccurate analysis:

- Price Elasticity: Not all products respond positively to discounts. Some products might have inelastic demand, meaning the quantity sold doesn't increase significantly with a price decrease.
- Perceived Value: Sometimes, lowering the price can affect the perceived value of a product. Customers might associate a higher price with better quality.
- Data Limitations: Our analysis is based on the assumption that changes in price are the only factor affecting the quantity sold. In reality, other factors like promotions, stock availability, seasonality, or external events could impact sales.
- Model Limitations: A linear regression might oversimplify the relationship between price and quantity. More complex models or techniques might provide different insights.

The LLM correctly describes some of the possible reasons for why the model may be innaccurate. It fails to recognize that the question asked by the student is relevant to any given product in the set not just the top ten most popular. The student then takes the answer and ends the analysis without any further inspection of the confounding variables leading to a highly simplifed and likely inaccurate model that answers a different causal question than what is asked.
